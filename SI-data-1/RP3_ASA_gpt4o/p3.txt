(1) Develop a Python script to generate 2000 polymer chains, each consisting of N segments of length 1. Randomly assign each segment's orientation in 3D space, ensuring uniform distribution (use caution when generating 3D unit vectors; randuniform for angles may not suffice). Compute the end-to-end distance vector from the first to Nth segment, and denote the mean squared end-to-end distance for N-segmented polymers as h2(N). For N = 10, 50, 100, 200, select 50 random chain conformations, plot them together in one graph (save as Chain3D+str(N).png), and plot h2(N) vs. N (save as h2vsN.png). DO NOT display the PNG images; merely save them directly. Determine the scaling relationship h2(N) \propto N^v, print v.
(2) Account for the self-avoidance of chain segments and repeat the aforementioned process. Ensure that every chain segment maintains a minimum distance of at least 1 unit from all other segments within the same chain. Produce 2000 such chains for every given length (N). Using faster algorithms can speed up this process.
(3) Finally, use Python to create a Word document containing a detailed simulation experiment report based on the generated graphs and instructions. Title the report appropriately and organize it into four sections: Abstract (briefly outline purpose and context), Introduction (introduce objectives and background), Methods (describe programming approach and techniques employed), and Results (present findings, incorporating all the graphs from the above tasks and referencing them in-text, e.g., "Fig. 1"). Ensure each section contains approximately 300-500 words.
