# Before running ASA
- Download the following Python packages: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, python-docx.
- Replace the API key in AI4SCI_VE13.py and AI4SCI_VE14.py with yours.

# Windows CMD command to run ASA
```python AI4SCI_VE14.py -s p4.txt > out.txt```

AutoProg AI4SCI_VE14.py will read the RP in p4.txt and autonomously run the simulation research process for 20 times. The LLM conversation history is stored in out.txt. 

**You can replace the content of p4.txt with your own RP to initiate your research process.**
