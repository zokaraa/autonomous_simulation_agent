# Abstract Section

doc.add_paragraph(
    "This report outlines the computational simulation findings of polymer chains "
    "in 3D space. The experiment aimed to analyze the behavior of polymer chains "
    "by calculating the mean squared end-to-end distance for increasingly "
    "long polymers, examining their scaling properties relative to chain length."

# Introduction Section
doc.add_heading('Introduction', level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "The objective of this scientific experiment was to perform a series of simulations "
    "to understand the physical behavior of polymer chains as their segment length "
    "increases. Polymers are large molecules, or macromolecules, composed of many repeated subunits. "
    "Understanding their properties is crucial for applications in material science, biology, and nanotechnology."

# Methods Section
doc.add_heading('Methods', level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "The methodology implemented involved simulating 2000 polymer chains with varying segment lengths. "
    "Each segment orientation was randomly assigned in a 3D space. The primary programming language used "
    "was Python, utilizing libraries such as NumPy for numerical operations and Matplotlib for plotting. "
    "Chains were plotted for different segment counts, and the mean squared end-to-end distance was calculated."
)

# Results Section
doc.add_heading('Results', level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "The findings from the simulation experiment were significant in illustrating the effect of chain "
    "length on the end-to-end distance. The plots depicting polymer chains for N=10, 50, 100, 200, and 400 segments are shown below:"

doc.add_paragraph(
    "Additionally, a plot of the mean squared end-to-end distance vs. the number of segments (N) revealed "
    "a scaling relationship, indicative of a physical polymer's expansive behavior in a three-dimensional space."

doc.add_paragraph(
    "The scaling exponent v, calculated from the plot, is approximately 1.03, indicating that h2(N) â‰ˆ N^1.03. "
    "This value suggests slight deviation from ideal random walk behavior theoretically expected for polymers in a free space."
