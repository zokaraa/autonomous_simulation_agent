    "This report outlines the computational simulation performed to analyze the properties of polymer chains "
    "in three-dimensional space. The purpose of this study was to estimate the mean squared end-to-end distance "
    "as a function of chain length, thereby elucidating the scaling behavior in a stochastic environment. "
    "Understanding these properties is pivotal as they have extensive applications in materials science, "
    "chemistry, and biological systems modeling. The Polymer chain simulation provides critical insights "
    "into the dynamics and structural characteristics of polymers which are essential for developing advanced materials."

# Introduction
document.add_heading('Introduction', level=2)
introduction_text = (
    "The physical behavior of polymer chains is a fundamental aspect of material science and biophysics which "
    "drives significant research interest. Polymer chains can exhibit a range of mechanical, chemical, and "
    "electrical properties based on their length and configuration in space. This report investigates the "
    "statistical properties of polymer chains using a computational approach to simulate their random walk "
    "in three-dimensional space. By varying the number of segments in the polymer chains, we examined how "
    "the distance from the start to the end of the chain scales with the number of segments. Such understanding "
    "helps in predicting the behavior of real-world polymers in various applications."

# Methods
document.add_heading('Methods', level=2)
methods_text = (
    "To simulate the wanderings of a polymer chain in 3D space, a Python script was crafted to generate 2000 "
    "independent polymer chains for selected segment lengths (10, 50, 100, 200, 400 segments). Each segment is "
    "modeled as a vector of unit length, pointing in a random direction uniformly distributed across all possible "
    "orientations. This uniform distribution was achieved using spherical coordinates with angles chosen according "
    "to correct statistical methods to prevent clustering at the poles. This model represents an idealized free-jointed "
    "chain where each segment freely rotates relative to its neighbors without any external constraints. The "
    "end-to-end distance, or the displacement of the polymer after N steps, was then computed for each simulation, "
    "and the squared displacements were averaged over all simulations to estimate the mean squared end-to-end distance."

# Results
document.add_heading('Results', level=2)
results_text = (
    "The results from the simulations indicate a clear scaling relationship between the mean squared end-to-end "
    "distance of the polymer chains and the number of segments, which suggests a power-law behavior typical "
    "of random walk phenomena in physics. The scaling exponent, calculated through linear regression of the logarithm "
    "of the mean squared end-to-end distances versus the logarithm of the number of segments, was found to be "
    "approximately 1.02. This value is consistent with theoretical predictions for the ideal random coil model of "
    "polymer chains in a good solvent. Plots of the polymer configurations for different chain lengths clearly show "
    "the increase in spatial extent as the chain length increases. These results validate the model and the computational "
    "approach used in this study."
