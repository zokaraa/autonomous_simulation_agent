# autonomous_simulation_agent
This study explores the feasibility of constructing an **autonomous simulation agent (ASA) powered by LLM to automate an entire simulation research process, from experimental design, remote upload and simulation execution, data analysis, to report compilation**, after a research plan (RP) is provided to the ASA by human researchers. The ASA leverages an **API automation program (AutoProg)** to enable multi-round text interactions with LLMs via API, thus achieving full automation of the research process. ASA can solve problems across different scientific domains. In our paper, we designed several RPs related to **polymer chain conformation simulation** and **gravitational simulation** to demonstrate the power of ASA. Our paper is available on [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15512](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15512).

**In this repository we provide the following supporting materials**:
1) We provide partial results for **gravitational simulation mission** along with examples of reports written by ASAs. ([SI.pdf](SI.pdf))
2) We also provide partial **AutoProgs** and experimental result files for RP 1-3 ([SI-data-1.zip](SI-data-1.zip)), main AI generating RP, and Multitier human RP ([SI-data-2.zip](SI-data-2.zip)). Please refer to our paper to view the specific content of RPs. Some API account and server information has been obscured; you can replace it with your own information and follow the instructions to run the AutoProgs.
3) Additionally, we have created a **demo video** ([SI-video.mp4](SI-video.mp4)) demonstrating the operation process of the automatic research system.
