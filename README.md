# Autonomous simulation agent (ASA)
This study explores the feasibility of constructing an **autonomous simulation agent (ASA) powered by LLM to automate an entire simulation research process, from experimental design, remote upload and simulation execution, data analysis, to report compilation**, after a research plan (RP) is provided to the ASA by human researchers. The ASA leverages an **API automation program (AutoProg)** to enable multi-round text interactions with LLMs via API, thus achieving full automation of the research process. ASA can solve problems across different scientific domains. In our paper, we designed several RPs related to **polymer chain conformation simulation** and **gravitational simulation** to demonstrate the power of ASA. Our paper is available on [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15512](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15512).

# SI information
[SI.pdf](SI.pdf) provides **RP1-3**, **partial results for gravitational simulation mission**, and **examples of reports written by ASAs** in SI.  *Please download the raw file.

# AutoProgs and experimental result files
We also provide partial **AutoProgs and experimental result files** for **RP 1-3** ([SI-data-1](/SI-data-1)), **main AI generating RP**, and **Multitier human RP** ([SI-data-2](/SI-data-2)).
AutoProg Notice: API account and server information has been obscured in the AutoProg.py; you can replace it with your own information and follow the instructions to run the AutoProgs.
## SI-data-1
([SI-data-1](/SI-data-1)) include partial AutoProgs and experimental result files for **RP 1-3**

# Demo video
Additionally, we have created a **demo video** ([SI-video.mp4](SI-video.mp4)) demonstrating the operation process of the automatic research system. *Please download the raw file.
