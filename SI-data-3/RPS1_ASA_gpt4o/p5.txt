(1) Write a Python program. First, use the Skyfield API to obtain information about the positions, initial velocities, and masses of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and planets at 00:00 on January 1, 2024. Then, using Newtonian mechanics, write a simulation program for the subsequent motion of these planets where the gravitational potential energy U = -G * m1 * m2 / r^beta. The time step dt should be half an hour, and the simulation duration is 700 days. Use Runge-Kutta 4th order method to avoid the accumulation of errors. Run the planetary motion simulation under two conditions (beta = 1 and 1.001). Finally, Plot the projections of the orbits of Earth, Venus, Mercury, and Mars on a plane in one graph (solid line for beta=1 and dot line for beta=1.001) and save it as a PNG image. Also, fit the orbit of Earth under both conditons using an ellipse formula, and provide the resulting function expressions. 
(2) Use Python to create a Word document containing a detailed simulation experiment report based on the generated graphs and instructions. Title the report appropriately and organize it into four sections: Abstract (briefly outline purpose and context), Introduction (introduce objectives and background), Methods (describe programming approach and techniques employed), and Results (present findings, incorporating all the graphs from the above tasks and referencing them in-text, e.g., "Fig. 1"). Ensure each section contains approximately 300-500 words.
