Write a Python program. First, use the Skyfield API to obtain information about the positions, initial velocities, and masses of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and planets at 00:00 on January 1, 2024. Then, considering the Earth's orbit as the xy plane, assume there is an asteroid located 6 * 10^8 km from Earth towards Mars' orbit at that time, moving at a speed of 20 km/s with a 15Â° angle to the xy plane. The asteroid has a diameter of 50 meters and a density of 2.5 g/cm^2. Please use Newtonian mechanics to write a simulation program for the subsequent motion of the Sun, planets, Moon, and the asteroid, where the gravitational potential energy U = -G * m1 * m2 / r. The time step dt should be half an hour, and the simulation duration is one year. Use the Runge-Kutta 4th order method to avoid accumulation of errors. Plot the projections of the orbits of Earth, Mars, and the asteroid on the x-y, x-z, and y-z planes (save as 'orbit.png', DO NOT display). Plot the distance variation between Earth and the asteroid over time (save as 'distance.png', DO NOT display).
